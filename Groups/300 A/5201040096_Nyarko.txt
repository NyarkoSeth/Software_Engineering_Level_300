									QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
1. What is a software process model and why is it important in software development?
answer; Software process models are convenient tools that developers use to map every step of their projects. 
They help project managers plan their processes, estimate costs, identify challenges and communicate with teams and customers.





2. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile software process models.
answer; The key difference between Agile and Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases that flow into each other, 
while Agile advocates iterative development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel.
Whether an organization develops applications with an Agile- or Waterfall-based methodology, 
all software development projects incorporate common aspects of lifecycle phases, including:
requirements gathering;
analysis and design;
development and implementation;
testing and verification; and
deployment and ongoing maintenance.


 
What are the key differences between the two models and 
what are the benefits and drawbacks of each?
answer; The key difference between Agile and Waterfall is that Waterfall breaks down software development into isolated phases that flow into each other, 
while Agile advocates iterative development cycles in which multiple lifecycle phases can run in parallel


3. What is Rational Unified Process (RUP), and 
how does it differ from other software development process models? 
answer; Rational Unified Process is the ultimate guide for assigning tasks and responsibilities within a development organization and developing high-quality software that meets the needs and requirements of its users. 
It was initially created by the Rational Software Corporation which IBM bought out in 2003.


What are the key phases and activities involved in RUP, and 
what are the benefits and drawbacks of using this approach in software development projects?
answer; The software design and development industry uses a variety of frameworks to create software, often customized for specific company needs. 
The rational unified process (RUP) is one software structure, and it can improve the flexibility and reliability of code by requiring it to follow specific building stages.
 Knowing more about RUP may help you develop project management and computer programming skills that you can use in an IT career, especially as a software developer or engineer.
The rational unified process (RUP) is a software engineering and development process focused on using the unified modeling language (UML) to design and build software. 
Using the RUP process allows you to operate business analysis, design, testing and implementation throughout the software development process and its unique stages, helping you create a customized product. 
You can use beta test models and prototypes of various software components in all phases of RUP to: 

Better achieve milestones
Calibrate elements of design
Troubleshoot concerns
Present the best possible software solutions
Often attributed to the company International Business Machines (IBM), RUP uses incremental, iterative and repetitive life cycles and steps to create software and website technology rather than designing it in one continuous process.
 Taking an Agile software design approach lets you adjust components and repeat the stages of RUP until you completely satisfy the software development requirements, goals and outcomes.
